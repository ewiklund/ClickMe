## Try to Click Me

This program consists of 3 files;  app.css, index.html and app.js.

When you run this program from VSC, please open the Developer Console to check the outcome.

At the very first beginning, the button has the text ***Try to click me!*** and if you click on it, it will change to ***Click Me!*** and move to another location. There are 3 behaviors:

* When you mouse over the button, it will print ***MOUSED OVER ME!*** and count each time you mouse overed it.
* If you managed to click the button, it will print ***YOU GOT ME!*** in the Developer Console.
* If the button moves towards the bottom of the page and you have to scroll to get there; it will print ***Stop Scrolling!***.
